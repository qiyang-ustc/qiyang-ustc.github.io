# Qi Yang – Tensor Network Methods & Quantum Many-Body Physics

## About Me

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the University of Amsterdam, working with [Prof. Philippe Corboz](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/p.r.corboz/index.htm). 

## Research Interests

- **Advancing a High-Performance iPEPS Toolbox**: Creating **next-generation** open-source tools to extend the boundaries of accurate simulation for 2D quantum matter. (**QRCTM**,automatic differentiation,preconditioning)
- **Parton Wavefunctions in Thermodynamic Limits**: Bringing field-theory-inspired and variational Monte Carlo (VMC) wavefunctions from finite-size lattices to the thermodynamic limit.
- **Resolving Quantum Spin Liquids & Subtle Competitions**: Employing state-of-the-art iPEPS to discriminate between near-degenerate phases and pinpoint transitions in frustrated magnets, especially in **near-gapless** regimes.

## Open Source Projects

- [**QRCTM**](https://github.com/qiyang-ustc/QRCTM): Super-fast QRCTM algorithms for iPEPS contraction
- [**Gaussian-fPEPS**](https://github.com/TensorBFS/Gaussian-fPEPS): Translate Gaussian-fPEPS to generic fPEPS
- [**varbench**](https://github.com/varbench/varbench): Variational benchmarks for quantum many-body problems
- [**TeneT.jl**](https://github.com/XingyuZhang2018/TeneT.jl): Two-dimensional infinite tensor network library
