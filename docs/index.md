# Qi Yang – Tensor Network Methods & Quantum Many-Body Physics

## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Amsterdam, working with [Prof. Philippe Corboz](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/p.r.corboz/index.htm). My research focuses on tensor networks and quantum many-body systems, with particular emphasis on developing novel computational methods and algorithms.

## Research Interests

- **Tensor Networks**: Development of efficient algorithms and novel applications
- **Quantum Many-Body Systems**: Study of strongly correlated systems and quantum spin liquids
- **Machine Learning**: Applications in physics, particularly differentiable programming

## Open Source Projects

- [**QRCTM**](https://github.com/qiyang-ustc/QRCTM): Super-fast QRCTM algorithms for iPEPS contraction
- [**Gaussian-fPEPS**](https://github.com/TensorBFS/Gaussian-fPEPS): Translate Gaussian-fPEPS to generic fPEPS
- [**varbench**](https://github.com/varbench/varbench): Variational benchmarks for quantum many-body problems
- [**TeneT.jl**](https://github.com/XingyuZhang2018/TeneT.jl): Two-dimensional infinite tensor network library
