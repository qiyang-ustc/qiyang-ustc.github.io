# Welcome to Qi Yang's Academic Blog

## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Amsterdam, working with [Prof. Philippe Corboz](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/p.r.corboz/index.htm). My research focuses on tensor networks and quantum many-body systems, with particular emphasis on developing novel computational methods and algorithms.

## Research Interests

- **Tensor Networks**: Development of efficient algorithms and novel applications
- **Quantum Many-Body Systems**: Study of strongly correlated systems and quantum spin liquids
- **Machine Learning**: Applications in physics, particularly differentiable programming

## Recent Highlights

- 🎓 Completed Ph.D. at Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2024)
- 💻 Developed several open-source tools for tensor network calculations
- 🔬 Currently working on advanced tensor network methods at UvA

## Open Source Projects

- [**Gaussian-fPEPS**](https://github.com/TensorBFS/Gaussian-fPEPS): Gaussian-fPEPS to generic fPEPS translator
- [**TeneT.jl**](https://github.com/XingyuZhang2018/TeneT.jl): Two-dimensional infinite tensor network library
